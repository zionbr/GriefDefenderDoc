:::: info
Unlike GP where you had to set multiple flag commands for pixelmon manually, it is now highly recommended to make use of the new Flag Definition system. A flag definition combines 1 or more flag permissions into a single group which allows you to toggle all at once via GUI. Any flag definition entered in your `pixelmon.conf` will be accessible via the Flag GUI config by using `/cf` command in game. The main thing to keep in mind is all flags toggled in game will apply to claim only. However, the flags you set in config that use `gd_claim_default` or `gd_claim_override` contexts will be applied on server startup with the `default-value` you specify.
